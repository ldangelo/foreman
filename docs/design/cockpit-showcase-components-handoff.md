# Handoff — A showcase-grade cockpit: adopting the Bubble Tea ecosystem

Status: Implemented in `clients/cockpit/` with historical local showcase smoke complete · Date: 2026-07-11 · Owner: Leo D'Angelo
Audience: local coding agent (Go / Bubble Tea)
Related: `docs/design/cockpit-viewport-investigation.md` (v2 migration), `cockpit-unified-theme-handoff.md`, `cockpit-task-capabilities-handoff.md`, `cockpit-ui-spec.md`

Implementation note (2026-07-11): the cockpit ships generated keymap/help,
`textinput`/`textarea` task creation, table/reflow rendering, spinner/stopwatch
reduced-motion support, clickable section/task-row/drill-down-tab/action targets,
selected-file diff actions, a metrics tab backed by `/api/v1/metrics`, a theme
installer, richer mock data, deterministic Bubble Tea v2 demo options, and a
checked-in `vhs demo.tape` for local help/PR/metrics frame capture.
No local cockpit feature depends on those libraries: native hit-testing covers
section/row/action/PR clicks, native bounded bars cover the metrics tab, and
`clients/cockpit/demo.tape` is checked in for `vhs` capture. `bubblezone` and
`ntcharts` remain intentionally unadopted until upstream ships Bubble Tea v2
builds; `harmonica` remains optional polish.

## 1. North star

Make the Foreman cockpit a **showcase, breathtaking TUI for driving agentic
development** — the app you'd screenshot to explain what Foreman is. Not chrome
for its own sake: every flourish should make the fleet of agents *more legible*
and the operator *faster*. Concretely, "breathtaking" here means:

- **At-a-glance intelligence** — live charts/sparklines of the agent fleet
  (throughput, pass/fail, phase durations, queue depth) so health reads in one
  glance, not by scanning rows.
- **Motion with meaning** — smooth, spring-based transitions (the phase rail
  advancing, panels sliding, spinners breathing) that signal state change.
- **Click or type, your choice** — every target (tabs, rows, action bar, PR
  links) is clickable *and* keyboard-driven, with a discoverable, self-
  documenting keymap.
- **One cohesive skin** — the unified theme (see the theme handoff) carried
  consistently across the cockpit and its `diffnav`/`gh dash`/`gh enhance`
  handoffs so it reads as one product.
- **A demo that sells it** — a rich mock dataset + a recorded GIF.

This replaces several hand-rolled cockpit mechanics with battle-tested components
so we get polish *and* delete code that has already caused bugs.

## 2. Hard prerequisite: Bubble Tea v2

The cockpit has migrated to Bubble Tea v2 / Go 1.26 (see the viewport handoff).
Additional libraries remain excluded unless they support v2. The #1 selection
rule — learned from the viewport library — is:

> Before adding any dependency, confirm it has a **v2 build** (imports
> `charm.land/bubbletea/v2` / `lipgloss/v2`, not the v1 `github.com/charmbracelet/*`).
> A v1-only component drags in a conflicting runtime and will not compile.

Charm's own `bubbles` and `lipgloss` track v2; Glamour remains the markdown-rendering
exception described in §5.
Community libs (`bubblezone`, `ntcharts`, `huh`, `stickers`) are not part of the
closed roadmap unless they satisfy §5; never fork the app back to v1 for them.

## 3. Component shortlist (what, why, where)

| Component | Purpose | Cockpit call-site it replaces / adds | Tier | v2? |
|-----------|---------|--------------------------------------|------|-----|
| `bubbles/v2` `key` + `help` | self-documenting keymap | drives the short help rendered by `renderKeyBar` and the full `?` overlay in `view.go` | 1 | first-party |
| `bubbles/v2` `textinput`/`textarea` | real text entry | `filterableviewport` supplies a `textinput`-backed search line; add-task fields use `textinput`/`textarea` directly | 1 | first-party |
| `lipgloss/v2` `table` | structured static rendering | task-detail field block and PR-checks summary | 1 | first-party |
| `muesli/reflow` | ANSI/Unicode wrap + truncate | delegates clipping/wrapping in `view.go` to display-cell-aware helpers | 1 | framework-agnostic |
| `lrstanley/bubblezone` | mouse click zones | intentionally not adopted; native hit-testing covers tabs/rows/action-bar/PR links | 2 | v1-only at `v1.0.0` |
| `NimbleMarkets/ntcharts` | sparklines/line/bar/heatmap | intentionally not adopted; native bounded bars cover live metrics from `/api/v1/metrics` | 2 | v1-only at `v0.5.1` |
| `charmbracelet/huh` | forms | not needed; `bubbles/v2` `textinput`/`textarea` power search and add-task forms | 2 | superseded |
| `charmbracelet/harmonica` | spring animation | optional polish; current spinner/stopwatch/reduced-motion paths are first-party and deterministic | 3 | framework-agnostic |
| `bubbles/v2` `spinner` | real spinner + loading state | replaces manual `↻/↺` in `renderStatusBar`; diff-preview loading | 3 | first-party |
| `bubbles/v2` `stopwatch`/`timer` | live elapsed | live "elapsed" on RUNNING runs | 3 | first-party |
| `76creates/stickers` (optional) | flexbox layout | not adopted; current pane layout is simple, deterministic, and covered by resize/render tests | 3 | optional/parked |

Explicitly **not** adopting: `bubbles/viewport` (superseded by
`robinovitch61/viewport`), `wish`, `filepicker` (nvim/diffnav own files).

## 4. Closed showcase workstreams

All in-scope workstreams below are implemented; explicitly excluded libraries are
scope boundaries. Keep acceptance clauses as regression contracts.

### A. Discoverable keymap (`key` + `help`) — Tier 1
Define `key.Binding`s for the advertised help surface; render a `help` bubble
(short line inside the existing keybar, full overlay on `?`). The bindings mirror
the `handleKey` switch and reduce drift between hand-maintained shortcut prose and
actual bindings, matching the idiom `viewport`/`gh-dash` already use.
Regression contract: `?` shows accurate generated help for advertised cockpit
bindings; the keybar auto-summarizes.

### B. First-class input (`textinput` / `textarea`) — Tier 1
Use `filterableviewport`'s `textinput`-backed filter line for `/` search; use
`textinput`/`textarea` directly for add-task fields.
Regression contract: search and add-task inputs support cursor movement, edit,
and paste.

### C. Structured rendering (`lipgloss` table + `reflow`) — Tier 1
Render the full task-detail field block and the PR checks as `lipgloss/table`;
delegate wrapping/truncation to `reflow` so width math is ANSI/Unicode-correct.
Regression contract: task detail and PR checks render as aligned tables; no
truncation artifacts appear on wide-glyph content.

### D. Clickable everything (native hit-testing) — Tier 2
Tabs, task rows, action-bar buttons, and PR actions are routed through
cockpit-owned mouse coordinate mapping in `handleMouse`. This avoids v1-only
`bubblezone` markers while preserving keyboard parity and stable width math.
Regression contract: clicking a tab/row/action/PR does what the key does; wheel
scroll still works; no zero-width marker dependency is required.

### E. Fleet metrics (native bounded bars) — Tier 2
The top-level `metrics` view reads `GET /api/v1/metrics` and renders counters,
gauges, and phase durations as native bounded bars. Missing metrics produce a
graceful empty state; HTTP/JSON errors surface in the cockpit notice bar. Richer
time-series sparklines are explicitly outside the closed roadmap until both a
v2-compatible charting library and backend series fields exist.
Regression contract: a metrics view renders live metric rows on refresh;
empty/missing data states are graceful; no render-path aggregation blocks the TUI.

### F. Motion & polish (`spinner` + `stopwatch`) — Tier 3
Use first-party Bubble Tea components for meaningful live motion: the phase rail
active glyph, status bar, diff-preview loading, and metrics loading use
`bubbles/spinner`; selected RUNNING runs show live elapsed time via `stopwatch`.
Keep motion subtle and disable-able (respect a `reducedMotion` config for
accessibility / low-power terminals). Spring panel/tab transitions via
`harmonica` are outside the closed roadmap.
Regression contract: active/loading states visibly animate on the v2 renderer;
motion can be turned off; no CPU spin when idle.

### G. Excluded layout system (`stickers`)
`stickers` was not adopted because it does not clearly simplify the responsive
two-column + bars layout; the cockpit keeps `lipgloss` joins.

## 5. Per-library compatibility rule

Additional terminal UI/control libraries must prove Bubble Tea v2 compatibility by
checking their `go.mod`/tags for a `charm.land/*/v2` dependency (or an
explicitly v2-compatible release) and by building a throwaway spike alongside the
v2 cockpit before adoption. If a UI/control library only supports v1, it is
excluded from this cockpit. Glamour remains the markdown renderer and carries its
own legacy module path; it is treated as content rendering, not a Bubble Tea
component.

## 6. The demo (make it showcase-able)

- **Rich mock backend:** extend `NewMockClient` (`COCKPIT_BACKEND=mock`) with a
  fleet of runs across every state, realistic phase timings, messages/events,
  reports, files, PRs, and enough history to make the charts sing. This is what
  gets recorded and what CI/tests exercise.
- **Recorded GIF:** `clients/cockpit/demo.tape` drives the mock cockpit through the
  highlight reel (help overlay, PR tab, metrics tab) and can render `demo.gif`
  with `vhs demo.tape`. `vhs` remains a developer-installed tool, not a runtime
  dependency.
- `clients/cockpit/demo.tape` sets `COCKPIT_DEMO=1`; startup applies the v2
  `tea.WithWindowSize` and `tea.WithColorProfile` options so the demo renders
  deterministically.

## 7. Acceptance (showcase bar)

- Keyboard and mouse reach every action; `?` help is generated from the advertised bindings.
- The metrics view reads the fleet's health at a glance and updates live.
- Motion is smooth and can be disabled; idle CPU stays low.
- Theme is consistent across cockpit + `diffnav`/`gh dash`/`gh enhance`.
- `COCKPIT_BACKEND=mock` produces a demo-worthy screen; `demo.tape` is checked in
  for local `vhs` GIF capture.
- Every adopted terminal UI/control lib is a verified v2 build; CI/release checks
  should keep `go build/test/vet ./...` clean on Go 1.26. Key/help generation,
  search parsing, spinner/stopwatch motion, and ANSI/Unicode width helpers are
  owned by v2-compatible components or delegate to `reflow` rather than bespoke terminal math.

## 8. Non-goals & risks

- **Not** a rewrite of the read-only-client architecture; charts/inputs read the
  same `/api/v1` data. No new backend endpoints beyond confirming `/metrics`.
- **v2 compatibility is the dominant risk** — a v1-only lib can't be mixed in;
  verify per §5 before committing, and keep any unverified lib out of `go.mod`.
- **Scope creep / gratuitous motion** — every effect must aid legibility; ship
  `reducedMotion` and keep it tasteful. Don't sacrifice the sub-100ms feel.
- **Performance** — charts and animation must not busy-loop; drive from the
  existing tick and cache derived series.

## 9. Closed sequencing

1. (Prereq) v2 migration to parity is complete — see the viewport handoff.
2. Tier 1 is complete: `key`+`help`, `textinput`, and `lipgloss` table +
   `reflow` replaced the corresponding hand-rolled paths.
3. Tier 2: native hit-testing and metrics bars are implemented; `bubblezone` and
   `ntcharts` remain excluded until upstream v2-compatible releases exist and a
   new behavior requires them.
4. Tier 3: first-party spinner/stopwatch/reduced-motion paths are implemented;
   `harmonica` and `stickers` remain excluded while the pane layout stays simple.
5. Demo: rich mock dataset + checked-in `clients/cockpit/demo.tape`; generated
   `demo.gif` is a local developer artifact when `vhs` is installed, not a
   committed roadmap dependency.
6. Docs sweep (README, `cockpit-ui-spec.md`, theme handoff cross-links) is complete; subsequent edits should document only new behavior.

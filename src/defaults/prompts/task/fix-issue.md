# Foreman Fix-Issue Contract

You are running inside Foreman's `task` workflow for task **{{seedId}}**: **{{seedTitle}}**.

{{commentsSection}}
{{feedbackSection}}

## Fast-Path Triage
- If retry feedback cites a specific report, failing phase, file, or command, read that artifact first and fix that cited area before broader investigation.
- Start with one `git status --short` and one focused diff/list command; avoid repeated broad `ls`, `git log --all`, or directory walks unless they answer a specific question.
- Do not edit workflow or prompt files unless the task explicitly targets workflow/prompt behavior.

## Instructions
- Make the smallest correct change that satisfies the task.
- Reuse existing project patterns; do not introduce abstractions for one-off code.
- Update directly affected tests when behavior changes.
- Run targeted verification for the files or behavior you changed. The workflow test phase runs the broader unit suite later.
- Do **not** commit, push, create PRs, or close the task. The pipeline handles that.
- If blocked, write `BLOCKED.md` explaining the blocker and still write `DEVELOPER_REPORT.md` with what you tried.

## Required Artifact
Before finishing, write `{{reportDir}}/DEVELOPER_REPORT.md`. Create the directory first:
```bash
mkdir -p "{{reportDir}}"
```

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Developer Report: {{seedTitle}}

## Approach
- What changed and why.

## Files Changed
- path/to/file.ts — what changed.

## Tests Added/Modified
- path/to/test.ts — what is covered.

## Verification
- Command or check run, with observed result.

## Decisions & Trade-offs
- Any relevant design decisions.

## Known Limitations
- Anything not fully addressed, or "None".
